# PetrolStationApp
Webapp that should let a user find petrol stations, their up to date prices, but with a catch.
It tries to account for the petrol used by getting to the station, so that it is possible to find the station that would be cheapest overall, considering that you have to use petrol to get to a petrol station.

Currently the backend is hosted on GCP via app engine at this [URL](https://imposing-water-291212.ew.r.appspot.com). It offers an API, the documentation can be found [here](https://imposing-water-291212.ew.r.appspot.com/docs).

The frontend is hosted by Netlify, a live version is accessable at [cyborgs.tech](https://cyborgs.tech).
